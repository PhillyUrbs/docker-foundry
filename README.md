This is a Docker container to help you get started with hosting your own [Foundry](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/foundry/about) dedicated server.

This Docker container has been tested and will work on the following OS:

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

This is my first Docker image ever created I am always open to improving it! 

> [!TIP]
> Add environment variables so that you can for example change the password of the server
> On the bottom you will find a list of all environment variables to change, if you want to use your own app.cfg file
> set the CUSTOM_CONFIG to true
> Here are all the possible changes from the devs [link](https://dedicated.foundry-game.com/) 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first server start can take a few minutes! If you are stuck in the logs on this part just be a bit more patient:

## Docker Run

**This will create the folders './server' and './data' in your current folder where you execute the code**

**Recommendation:**
Create a folder before executing this docker command

To deploy this docker project run:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name foundry \
    -p 3724:3724/udp \    
    -p 27015:27015/udp \
    -v ./server:/home/foundry/server_files \
    -v ./data:/home/foundry/persistent_data \
    -e TZ=Europe/Paris \
    -e SERVER_PWD=change_me
    -e SERVER_NAME='Foundry docker by Luxusburg'
    -e PAUSE_SERVER_WHEN_EMPTY=false
    -e MAX_TRANSFER_RATE=8192
    luxusburg/docker-foundry:latest
```

## Docker compose Deployment

**This will create the folders './server' and './data' in your current folder where you execute combose file**

**Recommendation:**
Create a folder before executing the docker compose file

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Older docker compose version needs this line before the **services:** line
>
> version: '3'

```yml
services:
  foundry:
    container_name: foundry
    image: luxusburg/docker-foundry:latest
    network_mode: bridge
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
      - SERVER_PWD=change_me
      - SERVER_NAME='Foundry docker by Luxusburg'
      - PAUSE_SERVER_WHEN_EMPTY=false
      - MAX_TRANSFER_RATE=8192
    volumes:
      - './server:/home/foundry/server_files_:rw'
      - './data:/home/foundry/persistent_data:rw'
    ports:
      - '3724:3724/udp'
      - '27015:27015/udp'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Backup & recovery

Backups are all saved in the folder you set in your volume for `/location/of/folder:/mnt/foundry/persistentdata`
There should be a folder in it called `backup`.

Per Default backups are activated and done every hour of the day you can change this by looking at the environment variables further below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command will overwrite your current save files! **Copy/backup the files before overwriting them!**

If you want to recover a backup you need to stop the container and unzip the files into your folder `/location/of/folder` with this command for example
`tar -xzvf /location/of/folder/backup/foundry-backup-DATE_AND_TIME_OF_BACKUP_YOU_WANT_TO_USE.tar.gz -C /location/of/folder/`
